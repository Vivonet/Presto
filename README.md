## What is Presto?
Presto is an iOS REST bridge that eliminates much of the tedium of communicating with a remote REST source in a way that is immediately intuitive to developers, without actually abstracting or obfuscating the REST interface itself like some other frameworks attempt. Presto simply reduces the time and steps needed to do what you already want to do, removing the mundane and time-wasting work of handling things like communication, serialization and change handling, and ties your remotely hosted JSON data directly to native objects via the Objective-C runtime. Presto is designed to non-intrusively tie itself into your existing data model and can automatically load your existing class objects with data from a remote source with minimal setup and a very easy learning curve.

For example, loading an object with a remote JSON definition is as simple as this:

	@interface MyProfile : NSObject
	
	@property (strong, nonatomic) NSString *name;
	@property (strong, nonatomic) NSString *email;
	@property (strong, nonatomic) int age;
	
	@end
	…
	self.profile = [MyProfile new];
	[self.profile getFromURL:url];

That's it! Provided your remote document looks something like this:

	{
		"name":"Logan",
		"email":"logan@example.com",
		"age":33,
	}

You can now attach completions and/or dependencies to self.profile and access the loaded properties from within the attached block. Presto uses blocks to decouple the asynchronous loading of a property from its use. You should always access remotely-defined properties from within a completion or dependency block, but they're simple to use and you can add as many of these as you want! Here's an example of a dependency:

	__weak typeof(self) weakSelf = self;
	[self.profile onChange:^(NSObject *result) {
		weakSelf.nameLabel.text = self.profile.name;
		weakSelf.emailLabel.text = self.profile.email;
		…
	}];

_(Important note: When using dependencies that reference `self`, because of the fact that the Presto metadata keeps a strong reference to the block, you should always use a weakSelf pattern to avoid creating a retain cycle. You don’t have to worry about this with completions because completions are always called once and dereferenced.)_

This block will be called whenever self.profile is reloaded from its remote source (but only if there are actually changes), allowing your user interface to automatically keep itself up to date with remote changes.

Note that MyProfile inherits from NSObject, not some Presto class. With Presto you can load objects of *any* class (even ones you don’t control), not just those that derive from a specific base class.

Presto’s aim is to make loading and manipulating remote data as simple as possible and does so by interacting with the Objective-C runtime to dynamically match server-side JSON attributes to client-side Objective-C properties.

Presto is also very fault-tolerant. If the library encounters a property or attribute it does not recognize, or a situation it doesn’t know how to handle, it will print a warning to the console, but otherwise continue without cause for alarm. This means your client and server side model don’t need to match exactly, nor do either of them need to be exhaustively defined. If your server returns information your client doesn’t need, you can safely just ignore it.

Presto is a work in progress and is not yet in a state where it can be considered complete enough to handle all scenarios, but it is already quite capable enough to handle a large majority of requests. My hope is that as it develops, it will become more and more general purpose. In the meantime, if you see a feature or ability lacking in Presto that you would like to see implemented, please shoot me a line or open an issue for it. Or of course you can implement it yourself. I’ve tried to keep the code as simple and straightforward as possible to facilitate modifications.

Presto has a few core strengths and design goals:

0. It is designed to be as unobtrusive as possible. This means a couple things: First, it is very easy to integrate into your existing projects. There’s no need to change your model class definitions aside from possibly adding a few empty protocols and optional overrides. Secondly, it means you can gradually migrate code to Presto from your existing infrastructure a piece at a time. You can use Presto when and where you like, and leave legacy code intact. Presto is designed to make your life easier, not get in the way.
0. It has a powerful yet simple **fluent interface**. Aside from the necessary ugliness of a few extra square brackets in your code, Presto has a very powerful and expressive syntax that lets you stack on exactly and only the pieces you want, without the need for bloated and complicated method signature overloads. With Presto, `nil` parameters are a rarity.
0. It is designed to be as automatic as possbile, loading only what is needed when it is needed. With Presto you just code and go.
0. Presto should make your coding more intuitive and less bug-prone. With proper use of completions and depenencies, your app will also behave consistently and react automatically to remote changes.
0. In-place loading means you can refresh your objects from their server definitions without blowing away other local data. Working on a single instance of an object means more predictable behavior and compatibility with a wide range of existing designs.

## Disclaimer
This project is in its infancy and is constantly changing. Expect breaking changes. You’re more than welcome to depend on Presto in your projects, but for now you should link against a specific build and be aware that updating Presto may break your existing code. I will try to keep a changelog of all breaking changes introduced from version to version to facilitate new version adoption.

## Installation
Presto is contained for the most part in a single pair of files: Presto.h/m. There is also a handy (but optional) NSObject+Presto.h/m category which exposes Presto methods on NSObject. This category is designed to allow for easy customization and selection of the methods that suit your project. You can expose as many or as few of these category methods as you like.

To install Presto, just copy Presto.h/m into your project and import it where necessary. It is recommended that you #import the optional NSObject+Presto.h in your project’s precompiled header (.pch) file to make accessing Presto on any object automatic from anywhere in your project.

## The Basics
Presto works by attaching a single "presto" metadata property dynamically onto all NSObjects. Presto makes this property available on every object, but only lazy-loads itself the first time it is actually accessed. Presto uses this metadata to remember things about the object’s remote source, including its URL, HTTP method, request body, request and response transformers, etc.

You typically start by declaring an object’s remote location with one of four methods:
- getFromURL:
- putToURL:
- postToURL:
- deleteFromURL:

Each of these accepts an NSURL and returns a copy of the **PrestoMetadata** object that represents the source, allowing you to chain additional configuration calls together one after the other.

For example, to modify the headers in the request sent to the server, you need only attach a transformer via the **withRequestTransformer:** method:

	[[self.profile getFromURL:url] withRequestTransformer:^(NSMutableURLRequest *request) {
		[request setValue:myUserAgent forHTTPHeaderField:@"User-Agent"];
	}];

(You can also attach global request and response transformers for your app via the **addGlobalRequestTransformer:** and **addGlobalResponseTransformer:** Presto class methods.)

You can call these methods on any object (so long as the NSObject+Presto category is included and imported, or upon the extended "presto" property of any object if not). You can also call **getFromURL:** and **deleteFromURL:** on the Presto class itself, in which case a new instance will be created based on the type information provided by either the **objectOfClass:** or **arrayOfClass:** method:

	MyClass* instance = [[[Presto getFromURL:url] objectOfClass:[MyClass class]];

The **objectOfClass:** and **arrayOfClass:** methods, unlike the other configuration methods, return a reference to the host object itself (rather than a PrestoMetadata object), instantiating one on the fly if it doesn’t yet exist. This allows you to easily define your class properties in a single line. Presto metadata objects can create their own host objects if needed, or can be attached to existing instances just as easily.

As a rule of thumb, you should never need to directly capture references of PrestoMetadata. Rather, you should create (or act on) instances of your actual model classes. If you need to turn a PrestoMetadata object into an end model object, simply call either objectOfClass: or arrayOfClass:, or access its `target` property if this information has already been provided (or the target already exists).

_The `target` of a metadata object is its host object. This property may change to `host` to more clearly reflect that in the future._

## Presto Metadata
Presto achieves much of its magic by installing a single global “presto“ ivar to every NSObject-derived object in your app. This property is lazy-loaded and only installed if it is actually accessed (and the footprint of accessing it is tiny).

The presto property acts as your point of interface into the Presto engine from any object. You can use it to perform REST related tasks and get source and state information about a remotely-defined object. You can also NSLog it to get a quick description of the state and source of your object.

The NSObject+Presto category extends many of the PrestoMetadata methods onto NSObject for convenience. You don’t need to use the category if you don't want to, or you can customize it if it conflicts with your own NSObject overrides.

## Lazy Loading
Pretty much everything in Presto is lazy-loaded on the fly only when it is observed. Simply defining the source of an object does not immediately result in a call to the server. This happens when you attach a completion or dependency to an object, which are the two ways in which Presto objects should be observed.

	self.myProfile = [[Presto getFromURL:url] objectOfClass:[MyProfile class]];
	// self.myProfile.name is nil here because we haven’t yet loaded the object
	[self.myProfile onComplete:^(NSObject* result) {
		// self.myProfile.name is now filled in because we are inside a completion block
	}];

You can manually (re)load an object at any time (for example to pre-fetch information that will be needed on the next screen) by calling `load`. `load` assumes that the object's source has already been provided by another means such as by calling `getFromURL:` on that object previously, or by obtaining the object from a call to `putToURL:` or `postToURL:`. For example:

	AddUserResponse* response = [[newUser putToURL:url] objectOfClass:[AddUserResponse class]];
	[response onChange:^(NSObject* result) {
		// update the UI
		// note that this will be called automatically once
	}];
	// …
	[response load];

_Warning: Calling `load` on an object with a remote source will cause whatever source it is defined as to be resent. If this is a PUT or POST, it will perform that PUT or POST again, reserializing the target payload object at the time of the request._

## Completions
A completion allows you to decouple the code that handles a remote object from the code that loads it. You attach a completion to an object via the **onComplete:** method. A completion will only be called once after it is attached, but is guaranteed to be called eventually, whatever the result of the server call may be, including failure. If an object is already loaded, the completion will be executed immediately and the object will not be reloaded. If you want to force a refresh of the object, use **loadWithCompletion:** or simply call **load** before attaching the completion (which is exactly what loadWithCompletion: does).

## Dependencies
If you want a block of code to be called every time an object changes, use a dependency instead, by instead passing the same block to **onChange:**. You can also pass an optional weak target to **onChange:** that will existentially tie the given block to the existence of the target. If the target disappears, the block will no longer be called. Typically the current view or view controller is passed as this parameter, because if the view disappears, there's probably nothing to update anyway.

As mentioned, you should always use a weakSelf pattern when referencing `self` from within a dependency block. This is due to the fact that the Presto metadata (which is attached to `self`) keeps a strong reference of the block. If the block also keeps a strong reference to `self`, this will create a retain cycle and not allow `self` to be deallocated.

Here is an example of a typical weakSelf pattern:

	__weak typeof(self) weakSelf = self;
	[myObject onChange:^(NSObject* result) {
		// refer only to weakSelf within the block, never self directly
	}];

## Set Completions
So what do you do if your block of code depends on multiple different remote sources? Well, you could wrap completions inside completions, but that will quickly get ugly. Instead, Presto allows you to add a completion to an array of sourced objects such that the completion will only be called when *all* of the objects in it have completed:

	[@[firstObject, secondObject, thirdObject] onComplete:^(NSObject *result) {
		// all three objects will be complete at this point (but not necessarily successful)
	}];

Note that because this is a completion and not a dependency, and completions must be guaranteed to fire, this doesn't require the success of the individual objects contained in the array. Therefore you should always check the validity of your objects in your completion block as appropriate.

## Set Dependencies
Set dependencies follow similar logic as set completions, but being a dependency, the supplied block is called whenever *any* of the objects in the array change, and only when they change successfully.

Because dependencies are kept alive indefinitely, it is recommended that you pass a target object with your completions if you are not dealing with global instances. This weakly-referenced target acts as a canary to your callback. If the canary disappears, the block will no longer be called.

Remember, you can attach as many completions and dependencies to objects as you wish, so if you need to have the features of completions in one case and dependencies in another, feel free.

As with regular dependencies, you should use a weakSelf pattern in your set dependency blocks.

## What Doesn’t Presto Do?
As I've mentioned, Presto is still in its infancy. There are still some features and abilities that are planned or being considered that are not yet part of the framework. One such obvious omission is that of converters. There is no layer of conversion happening between a payload and your local properties.

For example, if your payload represents a date as a string or long, you'll need to convert these manually for now. The best place to do this is by adding a second local property of the desired type (e.g. NSDate) and adding a setter (or overriding setValue:forKey:) in your model class to set the converted value of the date property whenever the original property is set.

This is definitely one area I plan on improving soon, so hopefully we won't be stuck doing this for too much longer.
